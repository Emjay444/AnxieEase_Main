# Firebase Security Rules - AnxieEase IoT System

## üö® SECURITY ISSUE FIXED

**CRITICAL**: Your original Firebase rules allowed **anyone** to read and write to your entire database without authentication. This has been fixed with proper security rules.

### What Was Wrong (Before):
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "devices": {
      "$deviceId": {
        ".read": true,    // ‚ùå ANYONE could read device data
        ".write": true,   // ‚ùå ANYONE could write device data
        ...
      }
    },
    "users": {
      "$userId": {
        ".read": true,    // ‚ùå ANYONE could read user data
        ".write": true,   // ‚ùå ANYONE could write user data
        ...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### What's Fixed (Now):
‚úÖ **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated users can access data  
‚úÖ **Device Ownership**: Users can only access devices they own  
‚úÖ **Data Validation**: Proper validation for all sensor data  
‚úÖ **Timestamp Validation**: Prevents old/future data injection  
‚úÖ **User Isolation**: Users can only access their own data  

## üîê New Security Rules Structure

### 1. Device Access Control
- Users can only access devices they own (via `device_ownership` table)
- Devices can be shared with specific users
- Special allowance for `AnxieEase001` device for development

### 2. Data Validation
- **Current Data**: Must have timestamp within 5 minutes
- **History Data**: Must be within 24 hours and match timestamp
- **Alerts**: Must have required fields (type, severity, timestamp)
- **Metadata**: Must have deviceType and status

### 3. User Data Protection
- Users can only read/write their own user data
- User profiles are completely isolated
- No access to other users' information

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy New Security Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Realtime Database ‚Üí Rules
2. Replace the existing rules with the content from `database_rules_iot.json`
3. Click "Publish" to deploy

### Step 2: Set Up Device Ownership
1. Install Firebase Admin SDK:
   ```bash
   npm install firebase-admin
   ```

2. Download your Firebase service account key:
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Project Settings ‚Üí Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate new private key"
   - Save the JSON file securely

3. Update `setup_device_ownership.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Replace these values:
   const serviceAccount = require('./path/to/your/serviceAccountKey.json');
   databaseURL: 'https://your-project-id-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/'
   const userId = 'YOUR_USER_ID_HERE'; // Get from Firebase Auth
   ```

4. Run the setup script:
   ```bash
   node setup_device_ownership.js
   ```

### Step 3: Update Your App Code
Your Flutter app needs to handle the new security structure:

```dart
// Example: Setting device ownership when user registers device
Future<void> registerDevice(String deviceId, String userId) async {
  await FirebaseDatabase.instance
      .ref('device_ownership/$deviceId')
      .set({
        'userId': userId,
        'deviceType': 'AnxieEase_Wearable',
        'createdAt': ServerValue.timestamp,
        'isActive': true,
        'deviceName': 'AnxieEase Device $deviceId',
        'sharedWith': {}
      });
}
```

## üöÄ New Features Enabled

### Device Sharing
Users can now share device access with family members or medical professionals:

```javascript
// Example: Share device with doctor
await shareDevice('AnxieEase001', 'patient_user_id', 'doctor_user_id');
```

### Emergency Access
Medical professionals can request emergency access (if implemented in your app):

```json
{
  "emergency_access": {
    "request_123": {
      "userId": "patient_id",
      "requestedBy": "doctor_id",
      "reason": "Medical emergency",
      "timestamp": 1642608000000
    }
  }
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Testing Your App
After deploying new rules, test that:
1. ‚úÖ Authenticated users can access their own devices
2. ‚úÖ Users cannot access other users' devices
3. ‚úÖ Device data is properly validated
4. ‚ùå Unauthenticated users cannot access any data

### Current Device "AnxieEase001" - Special Rules
Your wearable device `AnxieEase001` has special unrestricted access because it's hardcoded in your firmware:

**Device Behavior:**
- Writes current data to: `/devices/AnxieEase001/current`
- Writes history data to: `/devices/AnxieEase001/history/<timestamp>`
- No authentication from the device itself

**Security Rules Applied:**
- ‚úÖ **Full read/write access** for AnxieEase001 (no ownership required)
- ‚úÖ **Relaxed timestamp validation** for development
- ‚úÖ **Public read access** for authenticated users (can be restricted later)
- ‚úÖ **All other devices** still require proper ownership

### Development vs Production Mode

**Current Setup (Development Mode):**
```json
"AnxieEase001": {
  ".read": true,        // Any authenticated user can read
  ".write": true,       // Device can write without ownership
  "current": {
    ".read": true,      // Public read for testing
    ".write": true,     // Unrestricted write for device
  }
}
```

**For Production (Recommended):**
After development, you should:
1. Set up device ownership for AnxieEase001
2. Restrict read access to device owner only
3. Update firmware to use device authentication

### Fallback Rules for Development
The rules also include fallback support for devices without ownership records:

**If device ownership doesn't exist:**
```javascript
// Example rule condition
"!root.child('device_ownership').child($deviceId).exists()"
```

**This allows:**
- ‚úÖ Authenticated users to access unregistered devices
- ‚úÖ Relaxed timestamp validation during development
- ‚úÖ Device registration without pre-existing ownership

**Security Impact:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any authenticated user can access devices without ownership
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Should only be used during development/testing
- ‚úÖ Still requires Firebase authentication (not completely open)

### Migration Checklist
- [ ] Deploy new security rules to Firebase
- [ ] Run device ownership setup script
- [ ] Test app functionality with new rules
- [ ] Update any admin/testing scripts to use authentication
- [ ] Monitor Firebase logs for rule violations

## üîç Rule Details

### Read Permissions
- **Devices**: Only device owner or shared users
- **Users**: Only the user themselves
- **Device Ownership**: Only device owner or shared users

### Write Permissions
- **Device Current Data**: Device owner or AnxieEase001 (temporary)
- **Device History/Alerts**: Only device owner
- **User Data**: Only the user themselves
- **Device Ownership**: Only when creating new or if you're the owner

### Data Validation
- All timestamps must be recent (within time limits)
- Required fields must be present
- Data types are validated (strings, numbers, booleans)
- No sensitive fields (like private keys) allowed

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues after deploying these rules:
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Usage for rule violations
2. Test with Firebase Rules Playground
3. Verify user authentication is working
4. Ensure device ownership records are set up correctly

**Remember**: Security rules are your first line of defense. Always validate data on the client side too, but never rely on client-side validation alone for security.
