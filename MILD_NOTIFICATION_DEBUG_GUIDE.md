# 🚨 MILD NOTIFICATION DEBUGGING CHECKLIST

## Issues Identified:

1. ❌ Mild notifications not showing popup (only notification bar)
2. ❌ Using default phone sound instead of mild_alert.mp3

## Changes Made:

### 📱 Flutter App Changes:

✅ Created ultra-aggressive channel: `mild_anxiety_alerts_v3`
✅ Set `NotificationImportance.Max` (highest possible)
✅ Enabled `criticalAlerts: true`
✅ Set `category: NotificationCategory.Alarm` for all notifications
✅ Enabled `fullScreenIntent: true` and `criticalAlert: true`
✅ Removed conflicting `customSound` from notification content
✅ Let channel handle sound completely via `soundSource`

### 🔥 Firebase Functions Changes:

✅ Updated channel ID to `mild_anxiety_alerts_v3`
✅ Set `androidPriority: "max"` (highest FCM priority)
✅ Maintained `priority: "high"`

## 🧪 Testing Steps:

### Step 1: Uninstall & Reinstall App

**CRITICAL**: Android notification channels are cached. You MUST:

1. Completely uninstall AnxieEase app
2. Reinstall from scratch
3. Grant all notification permissions when prompted

### Step 2: Test Simple Notification

Run: `node test_mild_notification_popup.js`

- This sends one simple mild notification
- Check: Does it pop up immediately?
- Check: Does it play mild_alert.mp3?

### Step 3: Test Full Simulation

Run: `node test_mild_anxiety.js`

- This runs full 60-second realistic test
- Check: Popup behavior throughout test

### Step 4: Compare with Working Notifications

Run: `node test_moderate_anxiety.js`

- Moderate notifications should still work
- Compare popup behavior between mild and moderate

## 🔍 What to Check:

### Popup Display:

- [ ] Notification appears on screen immediately (heads-up)
- [ ] Shows green color theme
- [ ] Shows "Mild Anxiety Emergency Test" as channel name
- [ ] Appears even when app is closed
- [ ] Wakes up the screen

### Sound Behavior:

- [ ] Plays mild_alert.mp3 (gentle sound)
- [ ] NOT default phone notification sound
- [ ] Sound plays immediately when notification appears
- [ ] Custom sound is distinct from moderate/severe sounds

### Android Settings Check:

- [ ] Go to Android Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > Notifications
- [ ] Find "Mild Anxiety Emergency Test" channel
- [ ] Verify it shows "High importance" or "Urgent"
- [ ] Check if sound is set to custom sound (not default)

## 🚨 If Still Not Working:

### Possible Android Issues:

1. **Do Not Disturb Mode**: Check if DND is blocking notifications
2. **Battery Optimization**: Disable battery optimization for AnxieEase
3. **Notification Access**: Ensure app has full notification permissions
4. **Android Version**: Some Android versions handle popup differently

### Emergency Debug Options:

1. Check Android notification settings manually
2. Test on different Android device if available
3. Temporarily use `NotificationImportance.Max` for moderate/severe to compare
4. Check Android system logs for notification delivery

### Sound Debug:

1. Verify mild_alert.mp3 exists in android/app/src/main/res/raw/
2. Check if file is corrupted or wrong format
3. Try using a different sound file for testing
4. Check Android sound settings (notification volume, sound profile)

## 📊 Expected Final Result:

- ✅ Mild notifications pop up immediately like moderate/severe
- ✅ Custom mild_alert.mp3 sound plays (not default)
- ✅ Green color theme preserved
- ✅ Shows "Mild Anxiety Emergency Test" channel name
- ✅ All anxiety levels have consistent popup behavior
