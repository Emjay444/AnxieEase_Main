- âœ… Sensor data structure is correct
- âœ… Timestamps are current
- âœ… Anxiety detection data appears

#### 2.3 Automated IoT Testing

**Objective**: Run comprehensive automated tests

**Steps**:

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
node comprehensive_iot_test.js

# Follow the interactive menu:
# 1. Choose option 2 for "Run Full Test Suite"
# 2. Keep your Flutter app open to see real-time updates
# 3. Watch for notifications on your device
```

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… All 5 test scenarios execute successfully
- âœ… Firebase data updates for each test
- âœ… Notifications appear for anxiety levels
- âœ… No errors in test console

---

### **Phase 3: System Integration Testing**

#### 3.1 Cloud Functions Test

**Objective**: Verify anxiety detection triggers notifications

**Manual Test**:

```javascript
# Run specific anxiety scenario tests
node comprehensive_iot_test.js
# Choose option 1 â†’ Select "Severe Anxiety Attack"
# Watch for high-priority notification
```

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Cloud Function processes data change
- âœ… FCM notification sent to device
- âœ… Notification appears with correct severity
- âœ… No duplicate notifications

#### 3.2 Background Persistence Test

**Objective**: Verify IoT gateway continues when app is backgrounded

**Steps**:

1. Start IoT Gateway in app
2. Verify data is flowing (Watch tab shows updates)
3. Press home button to background the app
4. Wait 2-3 minutes
5. Check Firebase Console for continued data updates
6. Return to app and verify connection still active

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Data continues flowing when app is backgrounded
- âœ… Bluetooth connection remains stable
- âœ… Firebase updates continue
- âœ… App shows "Active" status when returned to

#### 3.3 App Termination Test

**Objective**: Verify system handles complete app closure

**Steps**:

1. Start IoT Gateway
2. Completely close AnxieEase app (swipe away from recent apps)
3. Check Firebase Console for 5 minutes
4. Restart app and check connection status

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Android Service continues briefly after app closure
- âœ… Connection eventually times out (expected behavior)
- âœ… App auto-reconnects when restarted
- âœ… No data corruption or errors

---

### **Phase 4: Real-World Testing**

#### 4.1 Device Wearing Test

**Objective**: Test actual device wearing detection

**Steps**:

1. Put on the ESP32 health monitor device
2. Verify "Device Worn: true" in app
3. Remove device
4. Verify "Device Worn: false" and heart rate goes null

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Wearing detection works accurately
- âœ… Heart rate data only when worn
- âœ… UI reflects wearing status correctly

#### 4.2 Range Testing

**Objective**: Test Bluetooth connection range and recovery

**Steps**:

1. Start with device close to phone
2. Gradually move device away until connection lost
3. Return device within range
4. Verify auto-reconnection

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Connection lost at expected Bluetooth range (~10m)
- âœ… Auto-reconnection when back in range
- âœ… Data resumes flowing after reconnection
- âœ… Connection status updates correctly in UI

#### 4.3 Battery Monitoring Test

**Objective**: Verify battery level monitoring

**Steps**:

1. Monitor battery percentage in app
2. Verify it decreases over time
3. Check for low battery warnings (if implemented)

**Expected Results**:

- âœ… Battery percentage updates accurately
- âœ… Battery level reflects actual device state
- âœ… Low battery notifications (if configured)
