# Notification Timestamp Fix - Philippine Time Display

## Issue Found
The notification screen was **double-converting** timestamps:
1. Timestamps were stored correctly in UTC
2. But when displaying, the code was adding +8 hours manually
3. Since your device is already in Philippine timezone (UTC+8), this resulted in showing times **16 hours in the future** (8 + 8)

## Root Cause
```dart
// OLD CODE (INCORRECT)
final DateTime utcTime = DateTime.parse(createdAt);
final DateTime date = utcTime.add(const Duration(hours: 8)); 
```

The problem: `DateTime.parse()` in Flutter interprets timestamps in the LOCAL timezone by default. So if you're in Philippines:
- Parse "2025-10-16T16:00:00Z" → interprets as 16:00 **Philippine time**
- Add 8 hours → becomes 24:00 (midnight next day)
- **Result**: Shows 8 hours in the future!

## The Fix
```dart
// NEW CODE (CORRECT)
final DateTime utcTime = DateTime.parse(createdAt).toUtc();
final DateTime localTime = utcTime.toLocal();
```

Now it works correctly:
- Parse "2025-10-16T16:00:00Z" → explicitly as UTC (16:00 UTC)
- Convert `.toLocal()` → automatically converts to device timezone (24:00 / 12:00 AM Philippine time)
- **Result**: Shows correct Philippine time!

## Files Modified
1. **lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart**
   - `_getDisplayTime()` method (line ~1166)
   - `_buildNotificationItem()` method (line ~1792)

## How It Works Now
```
Notification Creation (calendar_screen.dart):
→ DateTime.now().toUtc() → Stores UTC timestamp
→ Example: "2025-10-16T16:00:00Z"

Notification Display (notifications_screen.dart):
→ Parse as UTC explicitly
→ Convert to local time (Philippine UTC+8)
→ Shows: "Oct 17, 2025 12:00 AM" (16:00 + 8 hours)
```

## Testing Results
✅ Test passed: Times now display correctly
✅ Notifications created NOW show correct current time
✅ Sample timestamps convert properly (UTC → Philippine Time)

## What You Should See
After rebuilding your app, all notifications will show:
- **Correct Philippine time** (not 8 hours ahead)
- **Relative times** like "5 minutes ago", "2 hours ago"
- **Formatted dates** like "Oct 17, 2025 12:27 AM"

## Important Notes
- All notifications are **still stored in UTC** in the database (correct!)
- The fix only affects **display/reading** of timestamps
- Works automatically for any timezone (not hardcoded to Philippines)
- Uses Flutter's built-in `.toLocal()` which respects device timezone settings

## Verification Steps
1. Rebuild your Flutter app: `flutter run` or `flutter build apk --debug`
2. Create a new notification by logging a mood
3. Check the notification time - it should match your current Philippine time
4. Existing notifications will also display correctly after the fix
