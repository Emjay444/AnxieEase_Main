# Background Notification Fix Guide

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. **Removed Duplicate Notification Creation**

- **Problem**: The `firebaseMessagingBackgroundHandler` was creating local notifications using AwesomeNotifications, which interfered with FCM's automatic notification display
- **Solution**: Modified the handler to only process data without creating notifications - FCM now handles display automatically

### 2. **Added Default Notification Channel**

- **Problem**: FCM couldn't find a default channel when app was closed
- **Solution**: Added `com.google.firebase.messaging.default_notification_channel_id` in AndroidManifest.xml

### 3. **Simplified Background Handler**

- **Problem**: Complex notification creation logic in background handler
- **Solution**: Streamlined to only log and process data payload

## üì± Testing Your Fixed Notifications

### Step 1: Rebuild the App

```bash
cd AnxieEase_Main
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run --release
```

### Step 2: Test Background Notifications

1. Run the app once to ensure FCM token is generated
2. Close the app completely (remove from recent apps)
3. Run the test script:

```bash
node test_fcm_background_fixed.js
```

### Step 3: Test Severe Alerts

```bash
node test_fcm_background_fixed.js severe
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Device Settings to Check

### Android Settings

1. **Notifications**

   - Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > Notifications
   - Ensure "Anxiety Alerts" channel is ON
   - Set importance to "High" or "Urgent"

2. **Battery Optimization**

   - Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > Battery
   - Set to "Unrestricted" or "Don't optimize"

3. **Background App Restrictions**

   - Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > App battery usage
   - Allow background activity

4. **Do Not Disturb**
   - Check if DND is enabled
   - Add AnxieEase to DND exceptions if needed

### Manufacturer-Specific Settings

#### Samsung

- Device care > Battery > Background usage limits
- Remove AnxieEase from "Sleeping apps"
- Disable "Put unused apps to sleep"

#### Xiaomi/Redmi

- Settings > Apps > Manage apps > AnxieEase
- Enable "Autostart"
- Battery saver > Choose apps > AnxieEase > No restrictions

#### OnePlus

- Settings > Battery > Battery optimization
- Don't optimize AnxieEase
- Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > Battery > Allow background activity

#### Huawei

- Settings > Apps > AnxieEase
- Power usage details > App launch > Manage manually
- Enable: Auto-launch, Secondary launch, Run in background

## üß™ Verification Steps

1. **Check FCM Token Generation**

   - Look for "üîë FCM registration token:" in Flutter logs
   - Token should not be null

2. **Check Topic Subscription**

   - Look for "‚úÖ Subscribed to anxiety_alerts topic" in logs

3. **Check Background Handler Registration**
   - Look for "üîî Background FCM received:" in logs when notification arrives

## üöÄ How It Works Now

1. **When App is Closed:**

   - FCM receives the message from your server/Cloud Functions
   - FCM automatically displays the notification using the Android system
   - When user taps notification, app opens and processes the data

2. **When App is in Background:**

   - Same as above - FCM handles display automatically

3. **When App is in Foreground:**
   - `FirebaseMessaging.onMessage` listener receives the message
   - App can choose to display a local notification or handle silently

## ‚úÖ Expected Behavior

- Notifications should appear within 5-10 seconds when app is closed
- Severe alerts should wake the screen and show with high priority
- Notification sound and vibration should work (if enabled in device settings)
- Tapping notification should open the app

## üîç Troubleshooting

If notifications still don't work:

1. **Check Firebase Console**

   - Send a test message from Firebase Console > Cloud Messaging
   - If this works, the issue is with your sending code

2. **Check Internet Connection**

   - FCM requires active internet (WiFi or mobile data)
   - VPNs might block Google services

3. **Check Google Play Services**

   - Ensure Google Play Services is updated
   - Clear cache: Settings > Apps > Google Play Services > Storage > Clear cache

4. **Enable FCM Diagnostics**
   - Add to your test script: `admin.messaging().send(message, true)`
   - This enables verbose FCM logging

## üìù Key Changes Made

1. **background_messaging.dart**

   - Removed AwesomeNotifications.createNotification() calls
   - Now only processes data payload without creating local notifications

2. **AndroidManifest.xml**

   - Added default notification channel for FCM
   - Channel ID: "anxiety_alerts"

3. **test_fcm_background_fixed.js**
   - Proper notification format for background delivery
   - Includes both notification and data payloads
   - High priority Android settings

## üéØ Summary

Your FCM notifications should now work properly when the app is closed. The key was to let FCM handle the notification display instead of creating duplicate local notifications. Make sure to test after rebuilding the app with these changes!
