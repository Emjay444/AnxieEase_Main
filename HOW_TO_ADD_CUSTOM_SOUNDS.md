# 🔊 How to Add Custom Notification Sounds

## Current Status
✅ **Notifications are working** - different channels for mild, moderate, and severe alerts
❌ **Custom sounds not working** - still using default system sounds

## Why Custom Sounds Aren't Working Yet
The issue is that we need **real audio files**, not text placeholders. Here's how to fix it:

## Method 1: Quick Fix - Use Built-in Android Sounds

### Step 1: Update the Code to Use System Sounds
I can modify the code to use different built-in Android sounds:

```dart
// For severe alerts - use alarm sound
soundSource: 'android.resource://android/raw/fallbackring'

// For moderate alerts - use notification sound  
soundSource: 'android.resource://android/raw/notification_sound'

// For mild alerts - use default
// (no soundSource specified)
```

## Method 2: Add Real Custom Audio Files

### Step 1: Download Real Audio Files
You need to download actual MP3 files:

**Free Sound Websites:**
1. **Zedge.net** - Go to Ringtones > Notification
2. **Freesound.org** - Search "notification beep"
3. **Pixabay.com** - Sound Effects section

**What to Download:**
- **Mild**: Search "gentle chime" or "soft notification"
- **Moderate**: Search "double beep" or "attention sound"  
- **Severe**: Search "alarm sound" or "emergency alert"

### Step 2: Prepare the Files
1. **Download** 3 audio files
2. **Rename** them to:
   - `mild_alert.mp3`
   - `moderate_alert.mp3`
   - `severe_alert.mp3`
3. **Check format**: Must be MP3 or WAV
4. **Check size**: Keep under 1MB each
5. **Check length**: 1-10 seconds is ideal

### Step 3: Add to Project
1. **Create directory** (if it doesn't exist):
   ```
   AnxieEase_Main/android/app/src/main/res/raw/
   ```

2. **Copy files** to that directory

3. **Update the code** to use them:
   ```dart
   soundSource: 'resource://raw/mild_alert',
   soundSource: 'resource://raw/moderate_alert', 
   soundSource: 'resource://raw/severe_alert',
   ```

### Step 4: Test
```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

## Method 3: Record Your Own Sounds

### Using Your Phone:
1. **Open voice recorder app**
2. **Record sounds** you want:
   - Mild: Say "ding" softly
   - Moderate: Clap twice
   - Severe: Make urgent beeping sounds
3. **Export as MP3**
4. **Transfer to computer**
5. **Follow Step 3 above**

## Method 4: Use Online Sound Generators

### Websites:
- **Tone Generator**: Search "online tone generator"
- **Beep Generator**: Search "beep sound generator"

### Settings:
- **Mild**: 800Hz sine wave, 0.5 seconds
- **Moderate**: 1000Hz square wave, 1 second
- **Severe**: 1200Hz sawtooth wave, 2 seconds

## Quick Test - Try This Now!

Let me update your code to use a different approach that might work better:

### Option A: Multiple Notifications for Severe Alerts
- Severe alerts now send **2 notifications** 0.5 seconds apart
- This makes them much more noticeable
- Uses **alarm category** instead of reminder

### Option B: Different Notification Behaviors
- **Mild**: Standard notification
- **Moderate**: High importance notification  
- **Severe**: Critical alarm with action buttons + screen wake

## Troubleshooting

### If sounds still don't work:
1. **Check Android settings**:
   - Go to Settings > Apps > AnxieEase > Notifications
   - Make sure each channel has sound enabled
   - Try changing the sound manually

2. **Check phone volume**:
   - Notification volume might be low
   - Try increasing notification volume

3. **Check Do Not Disturb**:
   - Severe alerts should bypass DND
   - Other alerts might be silenced

4. **Try different file formats**:
   - Use WAV instead of MP3
   - Use shorter files (1-3 seconds)

## Current Enhanced Features

Even without custom sounds, your notifications now have:

✅ **Different channels** for each severity
✅ **Critical alerts** for severe notifications  
✅ **Action buttons** on severe alerts
✅ **Screen wake** for severe alerts
✅ **Multiple notifications** for severe alerts (more noticeable)
✅ **Bypass Do Not Disturb** for severe alerts

The severe alerts should already be **much more attention-grabbing** than before!

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Update the code** to use built-in Android alarm sounds?
2. **Help you find** specific audio files to download?
3. **Create a simple script** to download free sounds automatically?

Let me know which approach you'd prefer!
