# 🚀 Deployment Summary - FCM Token Persistence Fix

## ✅ Completed Deployments

### 1. **Flutter App Build** 
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **File**: `build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk (287.8MB)`
- **Build Time**: 244.7 seconds
- **Changes Included**:
  - FCM token persistence on app lifecycle changes
  - Periodic token refresh (every 5 minutes)
  - Token validation and auto-refresh
  - Enhanced assignment-level token management

### 2. **Firebase Functions Build**
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** 
- **Command**: `npm --prefix "functions" run build`
- **Output**: TypeScript compilation successful

### 3. **Firebase Functions Deployment**
- **Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS**
- **Command**: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only functions`
- **Target**: Project `anxieease-sensors`

## 📱 Next Steps to Test the Fix

### **Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Install the New APK**:
   ```bash
   # Connect your Android device and install
   adb install build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-release.apk
   
   # Or manually transfer the APK to your test devices
   ```

2. **Wait for Firebase Functions Deployment**:
   - The functions deployment is currently in progress
   - This ensures the latest Cloud Functions code is live
   - **Don't test until deployment completes!**

3. **Test the FCM Token Persistence**:
   - Follow the steps in `FCM_TOKEN_TEST_GUIDE.md`
   - Assign AnxieEase001 to a test user
   - Close app completely → Reopen → Verify token persists
   - Trigger anxiety alert → Verify notification received

### **Key Monitoring Points:**

**Look for these logs in the Flutter app:**
```
✅ FCM token stored in assignment node: AnxieEase001
✅ App resumed - refreshing FCM token
✅ FCM token persisted before app backgrounding  
✅ Periodic FCM token refresh
✅ Assignment FCM token validation passed
```

**Check Firebase Database:**
```
/devices/AnxieEase001/assignment/
  ├── fcmToken: "token_string"
  ├── assignedUser: "user_id"
  ├── tokenAssignedAt: "2025-10-04T..."
  └── lastTokenRefresh: "2025-10-04T..."
```

### **Expected Fix Results:**
- ✅ Users receive notifications even when app was closed
- ✅ Device reassignment properly updates FCM tokens
- ✅ No more "No anxiety alert FCM token found" errors
- ✅ Notifications reach only the currently assigned user

## 🔧 Technical Changes Summary

### **Code Changes in `main.dart`:**
1. **App Lifecycle Management**:
   - `AppLifecycleState.resumed` → Refresh FCM token
   - `AppLifecycleState.paused` → Persist FCM token

2. **Periodic Refresh**:
   - Timer every 5 minutes for active apps
   - Early refresh during first 5 minutes (every 30s)

3. **Enhanced Token Storage**:
   - Added `lastTokenRefresh` timestamp
   - Better user validation
   - Automatic cleanup on reassignment

4. **Validation & Recovery**:
   - `_validateAndRefreshAssignmentToken()` function
   - Auto-refresh if token missing or invalid
   - Multiple retry strategies

### **No Changes Needed in Cloud Functions:**
- The existing FCM retrieval logic in `realTimeSustainedAnxietyDetection.ts` was already correct
- Functions properly look for tokens in `/devices/AnxieEase001/assignment/fcmToken`
- Issue was on the Flutter side (token not persisting)

## 🧪 Quick Verification Test

1. **Assign device to User1**
2. **User1: Open app → Close app completely**
3. **Trigger anxiety alert** (simulate high heart rate)
4. **User1 should receive notification** ← **KEY TEST**
5. **Reassign device to User2**
6. **User2 should receive future notifications** ← **KEY TEST**

**If both tests pass, the fix is successful!** 🎉
