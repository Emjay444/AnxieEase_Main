# 🎉 NOTIFICATION SYSTEM - READY FOR TESTING!

# ✅ FIXED ISSUES:

1. ✅ Firebase Functions deployed with enhanced notification system
2. ✅ Device assignment synced (AnxieEase001 → User 5efad7d4-3dd1-4355-badb-4f68bc0ab4df)
3. ✅ Baseline heart rate set (73.2 BPM)
4. ✅ Anxiety thresholds calculated properly
5. ✅ Movement data available (accelerometer/gyroscope)
6. ✅ Enhanced detection algorithm active

# 🚨 CURRENT STATUS - READY TO TRIGGER!

Current Heart Rate: 95 BPM
Baseline: 73.2 BPM
Anxiety Level: MILD ANXIETY (95 > 88.2 BPM threshold)

Expected Behavior: Should trigger "Are you feeling anxious?" confirmation notification

❌ MISSING: FCM Token Registration
Your Flutter app needs to register for push notifications to receive alerts when closed.

# 📱 NEXT STEPS TO TEST NOTIFICATIONS:

1. 🚀 START YOUR FLUTTER APP:
   • Run: flutter run
   • App will automatically register FCM token when it starts
   • This enables background notifications

2. 📋 VERIFY TOKEN REGISTRATION:
   • Open your app
   • Check if notifications permission is granted
   • FCM token should be registered automatically

3. 🧪 TEST BACKGROUND NOTIFICATIONS:
   • Keep app running for 30 seconds (let token register)
   • CLOSE the app completely
   • Increase heart rate to 90+ BPM (light exercise/stairs)
   • Sit still and wait 30-60 seconds
4. 🔔 EXPECT NOTIFICATIONS:
   • Windows notification tray: "AnxieEase Alert"
   • Message: "Your heart rate is elevated (XX BPM). Are you feeling anxious?"
   • When you reopen app: notification should appear on homepage/notification screen

# 🎯 TESTING SCENARIOS:

• Mild Anxiety (88-98 BPM): Confirmation dialog "Are you feeling anxious?"
• Moderate Anxiety (98-108 BPM): Confirmation dialog with higher priority
• Severe Anxiety (108+ BPM): Immediate alert, no confirmation needed
• Exercise Detection: No alerts if movement > 30 + HR increase 20-80%

# 💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:

If no notifications after following steps:

1. Check Windows notification settings for AnxieEase
2. Verify app has notification permissions
3. Try restarting the app to re-register FCM token
4. Check if heart rate data is recent (device should be sending updates)

# 🔥 CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:

✅ Device sending data: YES (Heart rate, accelerometer, gyroscope)
✅ User assigned: YES (5efad7d4-3dd1-4355-badb-4f68bc0ab4df)
✅ Baseline set: YES (73.2 BPM)
✅ Functions deployed: YES (Enhanced detection active)
✅ Thresholds configured: YES (88.2, 98.2, 108.2 BPM)
❌ FCM Token: PENDING (Need to start Flutter app)

# 🎊 YOUR NOTIFICATION SYSTEM IS READY!

Just start your Flutter app, let it register, then test with closed app!

The enhanced detection will:
• Distinguish between exercise and anxiety
• Ask for confirmation on mild/moderate levels
• Send immediate alerts for severe anxiety
• Appear in Windows notifications AND in-app screens
